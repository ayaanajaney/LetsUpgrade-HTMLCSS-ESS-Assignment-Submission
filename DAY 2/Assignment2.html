        <h2> Captain America (Steven Rogers) </h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; color: black; background-color:purple; font-size:18px">Born July 4th in 1920, Steven Grant Rogers was the child of poor Irish immigrants, Sarah and Joseph Rogers. He had a frail youth, however, a strong sense of duty and honor. Soon, however, his father died and when he grew up to his teens, his mother died of pneumonia. When World War II broke out, Steve was alone. And seeing how the Nazis were destroying Europe made him feel like he needed to do something. When he tried to attend the military, though, he was rejected due to his frail body and sickly nature. Hearing about the boy's attempt, general Chester Phillips decided to talk to him about the experiment known as Project Rebirth.
           Steve accepted the offer and after weeks of tests, he was finally administered with the Super-Soldier Serum. His body and mind grew much more powerful and he was deemed as successful. However, a Nazi spy killed the doctor responsible for the project, leaving Steve as the only Super-Soldier ever developed during World War II. He immediately began training, both physical and mental, as his mind was being filled with false information in case of being captured by the enemy. He was being stuffed with info such as him having a brother and it would take until much later in his life that he remembered the truth. He was given the legendary white, blue and red costume alongside the disc-shaped shield made of Vibranium. He soon met a friend, Bucky Barnes and the two became inseparable friends during the War. On their last mission, however, Bucky was presumed dead when the two tried to stop a bomb-armed plane drone. The two fell into the freezing Arctic waters and the Captain was frozen solid, due to the Super-Soldier Serum protecting his bodily fluids from crystallization.
           Years and years later, Steve was discovered by the superhero team named Avengers. When they put him on a table, discussing what they should do with him, he bursted out of the block of ice. Confused and scared, he soon met Nick Fury, the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury reminded Rogers of his WWII past and after some time of getting used to the modern times, he was accepted as the leader of the Avengers.</p>

           <h2> Iron Man (Tony Stark ) </h2>
        <p class="pp">Howard and Maria Stark were billionaire weapon manufacturers who wanted to have a child. They tried to make one themselves, but due to problems Maria was facing the baby was doomed to die. To save the child, Howard desperately used his immense wealth to search across the world for a cure to the child's illness. In his travels he ended up saving an alien known as Rigellian Recorder 451. Recorder saw potential in Earth's future but also feared it would be crushed by other, more advanced races. To give Earth a fighting chance and thank Howard for his troubles, Recorder offered to genetically engineer the unborn baby for Howard and Maria to give him the intellectual power needed to bring the world to a new age of technology. Howard graciously accepted, and Arno Stark was born after a five month procedure. Unfortunately, Arno's health quickly degenerated to the point where he'd need medical help to survive for the rest of his life. Because his condition was so poor, Howard and Maria just decided to adopt the young Anthony Edward Stark.
           Tony grew up a rich man's childhood, without a care in the world and the greatest education. Tony's relationship with his father was rather strained, as he was abused and even forced to have his first alcoholic drink. Howard also forced into Tony his philosophies of war and how people have to clean up their own messes. At the age of 6, Tony began boarding school. Academics came easy to Tony, and he blitzed his way through school. When he was 15, he joined an MIT undergraduate program. By the time he was 17, Tony had already graduated with 3 PhDs under his belt. Life seemed peachy for young Tony, until the day tragedy struck.
           Howard and Maria were killed in a car crash orchestrated by one of Stark Industries' rivals, leaving Tony the heir of their fortune and company. Under his guidance, Stark Industries thrived. Tony lived for war, and loved his job of manufacturing weapons. He also lived a life of reckless partying and debauchery until the day he was in Pakistan demonstrating the power of his weapons. One managed to blow up in his face, leaving a piece of shrapnel piercing his chest and sinking towards his heart. While unconscious, Tony captured by the Ten Rings terrorist group in Pakistan. Held at gunpoint, the group forced the billionaire to engineer bombs for them and receive treatment for the shrapnel or be left to die. Being as clever as he is, Tony instead built a chest plate that would stop the shrapnel from killing him, then he built a mech suit around it. With his suit, he escaped the camp and dedicated his life to heroism. After returning from Pakistan, Tony spent his days fighting crime and eventually forming superhero groups like the Avengers.</p>

           <h2> Thor Odinson </h2>
        <p class="ppp">Born as the half-Asgardian, half-Elder God son of Odin, the All-Father and King of Asgard, and as the Norse God of Thunder, Thor was an adventurous yet ill-tempered deity, often travelling to other realms to do battle with Asgard’s foes. He spent much of his time in Midgard in particular, or our Earth, fighting as the mythic Germanic hero Siegfried and battling the ancient mutant, Apocalypse. As he became more arrogant, it became apparent to Odin that his son needed to learn the value of humility. To do so, he stripped Thor of his powers and memories, rendering him human and stranding him on Earth.
           Under the guise of Dr. Donald Blake, Thor grew to care for his fellow man, and eventually regained his old identity with Odin’s blessing. To this end, he opted to split his time between Asgard and Midgard, and helped found the Avengers, dedicating himself to the protection of Earth alongside the likes of Captain America, Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, Spider-Man and many other heroes, while upholding his responsibilities as a prince.</p>
